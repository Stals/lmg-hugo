# Useful Hugo Shortcodes & HTML

This is a collection of shortcodes and partials that I started while [migrating my gamedev blog to Hugo](https://letsmakeagame.net/static-vs-dynamic-website/).

## Shortcodes Usage
Put them in the `layouts/shortcodes` folder and use them depending on the shortcode itself. You can also add any of this reposity subfolders as [submodules](https://github.blog/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/).
